- 👋 Hi, I’m @HenryStarter2022. I have been a long-time natural language major(a PhD in language and cultural comparison), but I have made up my mind to also master the computer language!
- 👀 I’m interested in building a project that I think in the long-run will change part of the experience with which people use internet, and help more people to share and benefit from internet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software programming from scracth...It is never to late to learn, but I enjoy challenging myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with more expereienced developers and those who really believe we can make internet a more equitable and better place for all..
- 📫 How to reach me:you can reach me by my email:henryliushiyin@hotmail.com.
